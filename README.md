# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Description
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict passenger survival on the Titanic. It analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors influencing passenger survival.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Number of Rows: 891
- Number of Columns: 12

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Google colaboratory
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Methods and Models
- Used logistic regression and random forest classifiers for prediction.
- Applied feature engineering to improve model performance.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of 80% in predicting passenger survival.

## How to Use
- Clone this repository.
- Open and run the Google collaboratory files.

## Acknowledgments
- Inspired by Kaggle's Titanic competition.
- Leveraged online tutorials and resources for feature engineering techniques.
